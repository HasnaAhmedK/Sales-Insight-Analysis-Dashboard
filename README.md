Problem Statement: Atliq Hardwares, a prominent computer hardware business operating nationwide, is currently grappling with a challenging business landscape characterized by dynamic market shifts. The company has identified a pressing need to enhance its decision-making processes and regain control over its declining profit margins and revenues. To address this, the Sales Director has initiated a strategic move towards data-driven insights through the implementation of a Power BI dashboard.
The primary objective is to empower the top-level management team with real-time sales insights, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) that directly impact sales. With a geographically dispersed business model, the need for a centralized and easily understandable dashboard is paramount. The dashboard aims to simplify the viewing of sales data, eliminating the need for constant queries to zonal heads and streamlining the decision-making process.
